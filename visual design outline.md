Here's a detailed **visual design outline** for a minimalist 3D artist/developer portfolio site, directly inspired by the attached isometric coffee house diorama and your visual/technical specifications:

---

# ðŸŽ¨ **Portfolio Website Design â€“ Visual Overview**

## **1. Hero Section (Above the Fold)**

* **Background:** Full-width, rich charcoal (#1F1F1F)
* **3D Diorama:**

  * Featured center-screen in an **interactive Three.js viewport**
  * Uses your isometric **coffee house model** (GLTF format)
  * Subtle **ambient occlusion**, warm directional lights (soft orange-tinted)
  * Interactive with **orbit controls** (360Â° rotation)
  * **Mouse tracking** slightly shifts camera angle with easing
* **Overlay Text:**

  * Name: `JANE DOE`

    * Font: Inter, 700, 36px, uppercase
    * Color: #F5F5F5
  * Tagline: `3D Artist & Creative Developer`

    * Font: Inter, 300, 18px, tracking-wide
    * Color: #A0A0A0
  * Positioned bottom-center, light fade-in on load
* **Subtle Motion:**

  * Scene fades in
  * Neon glow pulses faintly around the 3D sign
  * Diorama rotates slowly by default until user interacts

---

## **2. Sticky Navigation Bar**

* Transparent initially, transitions to solid #1F1F1F on scroll
* Items:

  * Home | Projects | About | Contact
  * Font: Inter, 500, 14px, uppercase
  * Hover: color shifts to #D4814A
  * CTA Button: "Get in Touch" in warm orange (#D4814A), small pill-shaped

---

## **3. Projects Section**

* **Background:** Elevated surface color (#2A2A2A)
* **Layout:** 3-column grid (1 column on mobile)
* **Project Cards:**

  * Static isometric thumbnail of a 3D project (e.g. game asset, interior, object)
  * Hover:

    * 3D animation preview (low-poly turntable)
    * Card lifts with a soft shadow
  * Card elements:

    * Title (cream text): `Modern Loft Interior`
    * Tagline (muted text): `Real-time VR ready scene`
    * Optional icon overlays (GLTF/WebGL compatible, Unity-ready, etc.)
* **Transitions:**

  * Cards fade/slide in on scroll
  * Parallax scroll effect on background layers

---

## **4. About Section**

* **Background:** #1F1F1F
* **Layout:**

  * Left: Portrait or stylized 3D render of self
  * Right: Bio in cream/beige (#F5E6D3)
* **Typography:**

  * Heading: `About Me` â€“ Inter, bold, 28px, warm orange
  * Body: Light-weight, high line-height, #A0A0A0
* **Optional:** Timeline or skill icons (Three.js, Blender, React)

---

## **5. Contact Section**

* **Background:** #2A2A2A
* **Simple Form:**

  * Name, Email, Message (Input fields: #1F1F1F with #F5F5F5 text)
  * Submit button in warm orange, hover darkens slightly
* **Alt Contact:** Email and socials listed with icons
* **Decor:** Minimal geometric patterns or a tiny rotating 3D avatar

---

## **6. Footer**

* Small, centered footer in #1F1F1F
* Cream text: `Â© 2025 Jane Doe. All rights reserved.`
* Social icons with hover glow in accent color (#D4814A)

---

# âœ¨ **Interaction & Performance Notes**

* **3D Model Performance:**

  * Lazy-load all GLTF files
  * Use LODs and compress textures
  * Defer orbit controls init until loaded
* **Mobile Optimization:**

  * Touch gestures for rotation
  * Single-column layout adapts across sections
  * 3D scene reduces polycount or uses baked animation

---

# ðŸ§± Summary Aesthetic

* **Mood:** Sophisticated, technical, warm, and immersive
* **Inspiration:** Your coffee shop diorama â€“ detailed but cozy
* **Feel:** Balanced blend of art and code, where the 3D scene leads the experience, not overwhelms it

Would you like me to create mockup images or a Figma-style layout to visually represent this next?
